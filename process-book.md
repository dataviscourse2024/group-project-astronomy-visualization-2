# Process Book

[What to write in the process book?](https://www.dataviscourse.net/2024/project/)
In general:
- New ideas and things that inspired us (papers, visualizations, etc).
- Suggestions or ideas of possible modifications on the proposal.
- Description on how we did the data scaping, cleanup, etc, and initial visualizations on the data to explore it before starting to code, and how that affected some design decisions.
- Design evolution, options considered, decisions taken, justifications.
- Intent and functionality of the different design and interaction elements once implemented.
- Evaluation: What did we learn about the data? How did you answer your questions and worked in general? What can be improved?

## Resources used for the project proposal

* [Project Ideas Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pG8MIJ63O_l-x5lxE9TWMq5bsQBWVphontCbd75LPDg/edit?usp=sharing) contains the initial questions and design ideas. 
* [Project proposal assignment (Due next Friday Sept 13)](https://www.dataviscourse.net/2024/project/#project-proposal)
* [Link for data review](https://planet4589.org/space/gcat/index.html): use this to get an idea of what data is available to design the visualizations.

## Resources for design

- [Nasa Solar System Viewer](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/kuiper-belt/) for inspiration.
- [Earth orbit artificial objects viewer](https://whatsin.space/) for inspiration.
- [Solar System Viewer](https://www.solarsystemscope.com/) for inspiration.
- [How to choose colors for the visualizations?](https://blog.datawrapper.de/which-color-scale-to-use-in-data-vis/)

## Resources for development
- [Render millions of datapoints with D3](https://blog.scottlogic.com/2020/05/01/rendering-one-million-points-with-d3.html)

## TA advices

- Start early.
- Modify your proposal if needed (will prbly happen).
- Group communication is key.
- Think of the feature usefulness to the intended target audience before adding it.
